# Capstone-Project
This project is the final assignement in Coursera to get a professional certificate in IBM DATA SCIENCE 

The reason behind this project is to predict either the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX says on its website that the Falcon 9 rocket launch cost 62 million dollars. Other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. The price difference is explained by the fact that SpaceX can reuse the  first stage. By determining if the stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information is interesting for another company if it wants to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch.

in This project, we will start from collecting data, data wrangling, data analysis, data visualisation and finaly predictive analysis using classification models.

At the end, you can read the final report (Pdf) for data findings.
